### Hi, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

I have a kinda weird background between arts and finance.

My journey in web development began when I first tried to build some tools to help me in my finance-related job. 
When I least expected it, I became fascinated by coding! 
I'm currently on the lookout for a role in frontend web development, ideally working with React. 
If you're hiring, let's have a chat!
