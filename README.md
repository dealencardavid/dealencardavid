### Hi, I'm David! 👋

I have two great passions: art and technology. I discovered web development during the pandemic and immediately dove into learning and creating projects with React. Since then, I’ve been coding every day — always curious about new ways to achieve better results. Before that, I earned a degree in Theatre and completed a postgraduate programme in Performing Arts. Today, I’m a frontend developer who brings creativity, visual sensitivity and strong teamwork skills shaped by years of experience as an actor… and, of course, I still step on stage whenever I can.
